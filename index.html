  <h1 style="color:blue">Hello, my name is Steven</h1>
  <p>I am a slothbear at heart,
    <br>
    living with the bear necessities of life.</p>
  <p>There's a few things that sloth bears do that are interesting compared to other bears, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sloth bears fight tigers.</li>
    <li>Sloth bears don't hibernate.</li>
    <li>Sloth bears have claws meant for digging rather than climbing.</li>
  </ul>
