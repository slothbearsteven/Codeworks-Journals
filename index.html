  <title>Coding Journals of a sloth bear</title>
</head>

<body>
  <h1 style="color:blue">Hello, my name is Steven</h1>
  <p>I am a slothbear at heart,
    <br>
    living with the bear necessities of life.</p>
  <p>You may be wondering, what is a sloth bear, and why I seem so attached to it.
    <br>
    To start off, sloth bear was just an animal I started to like. It was really enjoyable to watch because they often
    can be funny when active. I also learned a lot about being myself and taking time to relax shortly after getting
    this name. I decided to stick with it to help me remember to take certain things easy, even if everything feels like
    it's metaphorically on fire.

  </p>
  <p>Before I came to Codeworks, I was working at a warehouse, stacking sodas on a pallet. I probably will not sweat as
    much typing as I did stacking, thankfully.</p>
  <p>A few interesting things about me are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>I love doing vocal impressions, and currently can sound similar to
      <br>
      Mario,Luigi, Patrick Starr, Zap Brannigan, Nicholas Cage, Bane, the Joker, and a few more.
    </li>
    <li>I really enjoy creating stories and universes, and use them in things such as D&D. </li>
  </ul>

      Week 2: This week has been interesting. I was not present on monday, and had to catch up to a curve I didn't
      expect since it wasn't in what I read. I felt successful with the basics of Javascript, especially after the rock
      paper scissors challenge. The thing that unfortunately stressed me out was the array challenges. Even though the
      loops seemed pretty average to solve, some of the arrays involved actions that I did not know or understand, and
      most advice on the internet suggests methods that involve downloaded script commands and such. I personally wish
      that with some of these harder challenges that we had a directed hint, or a probable answer missing some lines of
      code. The main example I can think of is the flatten challenge, and the flight challenge. Personally, I felt lost,
      and kind of kept doubting myself. I do know that these feelings will come and go, and eventually I'll figure
      things, but I just felt so stressed in the moment.
