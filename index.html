  <title>Coding Journals of a sloth bear</title>

<body>
  <h1 style="color:blue">Hello, my name is Steven</h1>
  <p>I am a slothbear at heart,
    <br>
    living with the bear necessities of life.</p>
  <p>You may be wondering, what is a sloth bear, and why I seem so attached to it.
    <br>
    To start off, sloth bear was just an animal I started to like. It was really enjoyable to watch because they often
    can be funny when active. I also learned a lot about being myself and taking time to relax shortly after getting
    this name. I decided to stick with it to help me remember to take certain things easy, even if everything feels like
    it's metaphorically on fire.

  </p>
  <p>Before I came to Codeworks, I was working at a warehouse, stacking sodas on a pallet. I probably will not sweat as
    much typing as I did stacking, thankfully.</p>
  <p>A few interesting things about me are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>I love doing vocal impressions, and currently can sound similar to
      <br>
      Mario,Luigi, Patrick Starr, Zap Brannigan, Nicholas Cage, Bane, the Joker, and a few more.
    </li>
    <li>I really enjoy creating stories and universes, and use them in things such as D&D. </li>
  </ul>
